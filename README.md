# Bribe-the-Birds
Bribe the Birds is a hex-based multiplayer strategy game. It has an expansive pseudo-randomly :) generated map with geographical features that greatly affect strategies the player may use and random structures that affect the gameplay.

Players start with their main base and can expand by placing buildings. Buildings have modifiers that are applied if they are placed next to a geographical feature.  

Players train units that can go to battle, explore, possibly diplomacy, etc. Matches should last about 15-30 minutes. 

There are many abilities/features that make the gameplay spicy hot girl energy. One of these abilities is BRIBING BIRDS so they can scout enemy bases or attack enemy troops. Other animals can be bribed, bribe the pigs to create communism :) among the animal kingdom, etc.
